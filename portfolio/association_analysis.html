         <h2>Association Analysis</h2>
         <p class="introduction">
            Association analysis is the process of finding interesting
            relationships between attributes in data. For example, in a
            market basket dataset, it may be interesting to note if
            transactions that include milk also include diapers.
         </p>

         <p>
            Association analysis has two main phases: frequent itemset
            generation and rule generation. Frequent itemset generation is the
            process of finding itemsets of a given size that have a minimum
            support; support is a count of how many records in a dataset are
            relevant to a given itemset. For market basket data, an itemset of
            size 2 for milk and diapers would have a support of 12 if 12
            transactions included both milk and diapers. A minimum support is
            used to make sure that frequent itemsets are actually frequent;
            that is, spurious rules are eliminated.
         </p>

         <p>
            Frequent itemset generation relies upon a principle known as the
            apriori principle. That is, if an itemset I of size S is not
            frequent, then no itemsets containing the items of I will be
            frequent. In addition, if an itemset J of size T is frequent, then
            all smaller itemsets consisting of a subset of the items in J will
            also be frequent. This principle is used to produce frequent
            itemsets efficiently.
         </p>

         <p>
            One such efficient algorithm is the F k-1 x F k-1 method. This
            method merges pairs of k-1 itemsets if the first k-2 sorted items
            are identical in order to produce a k itemset. The resulting
            itemsets are then tested for a minimum support. The algorithm
            starts with 1-itemsets consisting of all of the possible items
            that meet the minimum support.  The algorithm terminates when no
            more itemsets can be created; that is, a maximum size has been
            reached.
         </p>

         <p>
            Rule generation is the process of turning frequent itemsets into
            association rules. Associations rules are implications. A
            association rule has a confidence, which is a measure of how
            frequently items in B appear in transactions that contain A for
            the rule A -> B.  Confidence is use dto remove extraneous rules
            that do not correctly predict B given A in many cases.
         </p>

         <p>
            The apriori principle can also be applied to rule generation in
            order to produce rules efficiently. The algorithm starts with all
            items of an itemset on the antecedent side of the rule. Then,
            single items are moved to the consequent side of the rule and
            tested for confidence. If the confidence is not high enough, then
            no rule consisting of additional values on the consequent side
            will have a greater confidence. Thus, these rules can be skipped
            without consideration.
