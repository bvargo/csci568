         <h2>Anomaly Detection</h2>
         <p class="introduction">
            Anomaly detection is the process of finding anomalies, or outliers,
            in a given dataset. Anomalies may occur naturally due to rare
            processes. Anomalies may also occur due to abnormal or fraudulant
            behavior. For example, a credit card company may wish to perform
            anomaly detection on credit card transactions in order to limit
            fraud in case a credit card is stolen. This presents an issue: when
            is an event rare compared to being a true anomaly? In the case
            of the credit card company, when should the credit card be
            deactivated?
         </p>

         <h3>Statistical approaches</h3>
         <p>
            Statistics is the most straightforward way to detect anomalies.
            The mean and standard deviation, in addition to other possible
            summary statistics, are computed for each attribute of a set of
            data records. Using these values, it is possible to determine if a
            given data point falls outside of an acceptable tolerance range
            surrounding most of the data. These points are the anomalies.
         </p>

         <p>
            This approach works well for datasets with a small number of
            dimensions, especially for attributes that are normally
            distributed. If these properties are violated, it may be less
            meaningful to use statistics without additional approcaches to
            determine outliers.
         </p>

         <h3>Proximity approaches</h3>
         Proximity approaches to anomaly detection involve looking at close
         a given data point is to the nearest K neighbors. This can be
         directly found by running the k-nearest neighbor classifier
         and then finding the points that have the largest distances to the
         nearest neighbors.

         <h3>Density approaches</h3>
         <p>
            A density-based approach to anomaly detection determines anomalous
            data points by finding records in areas of low density. The
            probability that a point is an anomaly is then inversly
            proportional to the density.
         </p>

         <h3>Clustering approaches</h3>
         <p>
            Clustering approaches to anomaly detection involve running
            clustering algorithms on datasets and then finding groups that are
            small or are far away from other groups. The points in these
            groups are likely to be anomalies.
