         <h2>Application: The Classic Mushroom Dataset</h2>
         <p class="introduction">
            The mushroom problem started with a dataset of mushrooms
            containing a number of attributes, ranging from smell to various
            shape aspects, in addition to whether the mushrooms were
            poisonous. The goal of the project was to determine which mushroom
            attributes, if any, could predict whether the mushroom would be
            edible or poisonous.
         </p>

         <h3>Getting started</h3>

         <p>
            I started the project by reading the metadata file
            (mushroom.meta.txt), in order to get a feeling for the data
            contained within the dataset, such as the attribute types. I found
            that the data describes a number of attributes about mushrooms,
            and the primary ``objective'' of the dataset is determining
            whether a given mushroom is poisonous. If the edibility status is
            unknown, then a mushroom is classified as poisonous.
         </p>

         <p>
            Next, I looked at the data file itself (mushroom.data.csv). In
            particular, I looked at the format of the data and for any missing
            attributes. I found that the data was a standard CSV file with no
            missing attributes, matching the information found in the metadata
            file. The first attribute is the edibility of the mushroom, and
            the other attributes correspond to the attributes listed in the
            metadata file.
         </p>

         <p>
            For this assignment, I decided to continue using Weka. So far,
            Weka has proved easier to use than Knime, and I have not had a
            need to switch to Knime yet. For the purposes of filtering data, I
            used gnumeric, an Excel-like clone, in order to browse and filter
            the data as needed. I also tried Weka's filtering, particularly
            the RemoveUseless unsupervised instance filter, but it was not
            particularly effective.
         </p>

         <h3>Can you generate summary statistics that help describe the data?</h3>

         <p>
            All of the twenty-two attributes are nominally valued. That is,
            each attribute has a finite number of discrete values that are
            assigned in name. This makes it difficult to generate summary
            statistics, such as averages. It does not make sense to ask the
            average of bell, conical, convex, flat, knobbed, and sunken for
            the shape of the mushroom cap.
         </p>

         <p>
            That said, it is possible to look at the distribute of nominal
            labels among particular groups. The figure shows the distribution
            of edible vs poisonous among all of the attributes. This view
            allows an analyst to easily look at the data from a ten-thousand
            foot view. In this case, we can see that some attribute values are
            evenly distributed, while other attribute values are extremely
            rare. For example, the cap shape of c (convex) is rare, with only
            4 mushroom data points having convex cap shapes, while all of the
            mushrooms have the veil type of p (partial). There does not appear
            to be a single attribute that can identify edible mushrooms,
            though odor appears to come close if the odor values are grouped.
         </p>

         <img src="mushrooms-summary.png" alt="The distribution of edibility
         among the class attributes. Blue is poisonous, while red is edible." />

         <h3>Can the edible and poisonous data objects be distilled into groups?</h3>

         <p>
            Upon initial glance, not easily. As noted above, odor appears to
            come close.  If the odors N, L, and A (non, anise, and almond) are
            combined as one group, and all other odors are another group, then
            few mushrooms are misclassified.  How many is a few? Weka, the
            tool that produced the above analysis, does not have an easy
            mechanism to show how many records are a given color within a
            single bar. Using other tools, it can be shown that 120 mushrooms
            are misclassified using this method, as there are 120 poisonous
            mushrooms with no odor. This represents an error rate of just
            under 1.5\%. This is not bad for looking at a few colors on the
            screen!
         </p>

         <p>
            Taking a more scientific group, I decided to try clustering,
            seeing ``groups'' in the question. However, since the attributes
            are nominal, then clustering probably does not make much sense.
            There is not a good metric for defining the distance between two
            objects. Nevertheless, I gave the data to Weka's EM clustering
            algorithm. It ran for quite some time before I ended the process,
            knowing that the results would probably not be very useful given
            the nominal attributes.
         </p>

         <h3>Can a classification model be created that can predict whether
             mushroom is edible or poisonous?</h3>

         <h4>Tree-based classifier</h4>

         <p>
            To answer this question, I initially used Weka's SimpleCart
            algorithm, a tree-based classifier. It produced the following
            tree:
         </p>

<pre>
odor=(a)|(l)|(n)
|  spore-print-color=(k)|(n)|(u)|(h)|(o)|(y)|(b)|(w)
|  |  stalk-color-below-ring=(p)|(g)|(e)|(o)|(w)|(n)|(b)|(c)
|  |  |  cap-surface=(s)|(f)|(y)
|  |  |  |  stalk-color-below-ring=(p)|(g)|(e)|(o)|(w)|(b)|(y)|(c): e(4144.0/4.0)
|  |  |  |  stalk-color-below-ring!=(p)|(g)|(e)|(o)|(w)|(b)|(y)|(c)
|  |  |  |  |  stalk-surface-above-ring=(s)|(f)|(y): e(64.0/0.0)
|  |  |  |  |  stalk-surface-above-ring!=(s)|(f)|(y): p(16.0/0.0)
|  |  |  cap-surface!=(s)|(f)|(y): p(4.0/0.0)
|  |  stalk-color-below-ring!=(p)|(g)|(e)|(o)|(w)|(n)|(b)|(c): p(24.0/0.0)
|  spore-print-color!=(k)|(n)|(u)|(h)|(o)|(y)|(b)|(w): p(72.0/0.0)
odor!=(a)|(l)|(n): p(3796.0/0.0)
</pre>

         <p>
            Note that the first decision made is whether the odor should is
            one of a, l, or n. This is the same classification model that was
            identified above by looking at the summary diagram. The rest of
            the decision tree generated reduces the error to five mushroom
            instances, or 0.0615\% of the records.
         </p>

         <p>
            In some of the nodes above, the support of the path to the node is
            very low.  For example, the <pre>cap-surface!=(s)|(f)|(y)</pre>
            decision only affects four records, while the remaining records
            ``travel down'' the other side of the branch. This may be a case
            of overfitting, as these records may be anomalies, or they may be
            legitimate mushrooms.
         </p>

         <h4>Rule-based classifier</h4>

         <p>
            Weka's PART classifier, a rule classifier, produces the following
            thirteen rules. This ruleset correctly identifies whether a
            mushroom can be eaten in all cases for the data.
         </p>

<pre>
odor = f: p (2160.0)
gill-size = b AND ring-number = o: e (3392.0)
ring-number = t AND spore-print-color = w: e (528.0)
odor = y: p (576.0)
odor = s: p (576.0)
stalk-shape = e AND stalk-surface-below-ring = s AND odor = p: p (256.0)
stalk-shape = e AND odor = c: p (192.0)
gill-size = n AND stalk-surface-above-ring = s AND population = v: e (192.0)
gill-size = b: p (108.0)
stalk-surface-below-ring = s AND bruises? = f: e (60.0)
stalk-surface-below-ring = y: p (40.0)
bruises? = f: e (36.0)
: p (8.0)
</pre>

         <p>
            See the anomaly section below for a short discussion on these
            rules, and why more knowledge is needed to determine whether this
            model is overfitting the data or whether the rules could match a
            larger set of mushrooms effectively.
         </p>

         <h3>Do any anomalies exist in the dataset?</h3>

         <p>
            Maybe. There are certainly small groups of mushrooms that do not
            match rules that cover most of the dataset, as outlined below.
            Whether these small groups of mushrooms can be considered
            outliers, or whether these mushrooms happen to be part of another
            group that is not included in the dataset is specific to the
            domain. With respect to the dataset, these mushrooms may be
            outliers.
         </p>

         <p>
            Applying a traditional statistical approach is not easy in this
            application, due to the large number of dimensions, all of which
            are nominal attributes.  Thus, it makes more sense to produce a
            model and look at the cases that the model does not match the
            data. The data may be ``wrong'' in the sense that the non-matching
            records are outliers. Likewise, the model could be ``wrong'' in
            the sense that it does not encompass all of the complexities of
            mushrooms, either due to not enough data records or hidden
            attributes that could not be included in the model. For example,
            in the above approach of looking at the Weka colored output, are
            the 120 misclassified mushrooms outliers? Perhaps.  What about the
            8 mushrooms that final rule of the rule-based classifier matches?
            Perhaps. More evaluation is necessary, with more domain-specific
            knowledge.
         </p>

         <h3>Can any association rules be generated from this dataset?</h3>

         <p>
            Once again, I used Weka in order to answer this question. Using
            the apriori association algorithm with a minimum support of 0.95
            and a minimum confidence of 0.9, the following are the top ten
            rules generated by Weka:
         </p>

<pre>
 1. veil-color=w 7924 ==> veil-type=p 7924    conf:(1)
 2. gill-attachment=f 7914 ==> veil-type=p 7914    conf:(1)
 3. gill-attachment=f veil-color=w 7906 ==> veil-type=p 7906    conf:(1)
 4. gill-attachment=f 7914 ==> veil-color=w 7906    conf:(1)
 5. gill-attachment=f veil-type=p 7914 ==> veil-color=w 7906    conf:(1)
 6. gill-attachment=f 7914 ==> veil-type=p veil-color=w 7906    conf:(1)
 7. veil-color=w 7924 ==> gill-attachment=f 7906    conf:(1)
 8. veil-type=p veil-color=w 7924 ==> gill-attachment=f 7906    conf:(1)
 9. veil-color=w 7924 ==> gill-attachment=f veil-type=p 7906    conf:(1)
10. veil-type=p 8124 ==> veil-color=w 7924    conf:(0.98)
</pre>

         <p>
            All of the results that have a consequent of only veil-type are
            worthless. All of the data has a veil-type of p, so of course any
            antecedent is going to produce a consequent with a veil-type of p!
         </p>

         <p>
            After running the generator again, this time ignoring veil-type,
            the following rules are produced:
         </p>

<pre>
 1. veil-color=w ring-number=o 7288 ==> gill-attachment=f 7288    conf:(1)
 2. gill-attachment=f gill-spacing=c 6602 ==> veil-color=w 6602    conf:(1)
 3. gill-spacing=c veil-color=w ring-number=o 6272 ==> gill-attachment=f 6272    conf:(1)
 4. gill-attachment=f gill-spacing=c ring-number=o 6272 ==> veil-color=w 6272    conf:(1)
 5. gill-attachment=f gill-size=b 5402 ==> veil-color=w 5402    conf:(1)
 6. stalk-surface-above-ring=s veil-color=w 4984 ==> gill-attachment=f 4984    conf:(1)
 7. gill-attachment=f stalk-surface-above-ring=s 4984 ==> veil-color=w 4984    conf:(1)
 8. gill-size=b veil-color=w ring-number=o 4784 ==> gill-attachment=f 4784    conf:(1)
 9. gill-attachment=f gill-size=b ring-number=o 4784 ==> veil-color=w 4784    conf:(1)
10. stalk-surface-below-ring=s veil-color=w 4744 ==> gill-attachment=f 4744    conf:(1)
</pre>

         <p>
            Again, most of these rules are pointless. In order to try and find
            more interesting associations, let us remove all attributes that
            are predominantly dominated by a single value: gill-attachment,
            gill-spacing, veil-type, veil-color, and ring-number. The
            following rules are produced:
         </p>

<pre>
 1. odor=n gill-size=b 3288 ==> edible=e 3216    conf:(0.98)
 2. bruises?=t stalk-surface-below-ring=s 3040 ==>
      stalk-surface-above-ring=s 2968 conf:(0.98)
 3. odor=n 3528 ==> edible=e 3408    conf:(0.97)
 4. stalk-surface-below-ring=s ring-type=p 3472 ==>
      stalk-surface-above-ring=s 3328 conf:(0.96)
 5. bruises?=t 3376 ==> stalk-surface-above-ring=s 3232    conf:(0.96)
 6. bruises?=t ring-type=p 3184 ==> stalk-surface-above-ring=s 3040    conf:(0.95)
 7. gill-size=b stalk-surface-above-ring=s stalk-surface-below-ring=s 3064 ==> 
      edible=e 2920    conf:(0.95)
 8. bruises?=t gill-size=b 3016 ==> stalk-surface-above-ring=s 2872    conf:(0.95)
 9. edible=e ring-type=p 3152 ==> stalk-surface-above-ring=s 2992    conf:(0.95)
10. edible=e odor=n 3408 ==> gill-size=b 3216    conf:(0.94)
</pre>

         <p>
            These rules may be considered more useful. However, I am not a
            mushroom expert, so more domain knowledge is needed in order to
            determine the qualitative quality of the rules.
